Artifacts :

Wherever you read about continuous delivery or continuous integration it's recommended to use an artifact repository to store the artifacts even though Jenkins already stores them for each build.

An artifact repository and continuous integration tools serve two different purposes and one cannot be substituted with the other. 
Jenkins stores the artifacts as plain files without versioning while artifacts in an artifact repository can be version controlled. So you have a lot more flexibility in retrieving artifacts and governing them.

Artifact repository is a collection of binary software artifacts and metadata stored in a defined directory structure which is used by clients such Maven, Mercury, or Ivy to retrieve binaries during a build process.

In the case of the Maven repository, the primary type of binary artifact is a JAR file containing Java bytecode. 
A Maven repository provides a platform for the storage, retrieval, and management of binary software artifacts and metadata.

In Maven, every software artifact is described by an XML document called a Project Object Model (POM). This POM contains information that describes a project and lists a project's dependencies - the binary software artifacts which a given component depends upon for successful compilation or execution. When Maven downloads a dependency from a repository, it also downloads that dependency's POM. Given a dependency's POM, Maven can then download any other libraries which are required by that dependency. The ability to automatically calculate a project's dependencies and transitive dependencies is made possible by the standard and structure set by the Maven repository.
