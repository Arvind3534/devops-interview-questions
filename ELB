ELB:-
usecases:
- horizontal scaling by adding more and more ec2 instances.
- highly available, by deploying aur application across diff AZs.
- In case of zone failure our applcation still running and there will not be downtime for that.

Feature:
- Elb is specific to VPC
- It can load balance ec2 instance which are in same VPC
- It can't load balance ec2 instance across multiple VPCs
- It can't load balance ec2 instance across multiple regions (use Route53)
- It is a fully managed service.
- It can be secured by using security groups
- It performs health checks, to make sure it only route to the healthy instances.
- It support SSL termination, When we configure hhtps using ssl certificate.

Types of Elastic Load Balancers

1. Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
This is the previous generation load balancer that was used for EC2-classic instances.
It operates on both the request level and the connection level. But it doesn’t support features like host-based routing or path-based routing.
Once configured, it distributes the load across all the registered instances regardless of what is present on the servers.
Hence, it can only be used to distribute traffic to a single URL.

2. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
This load balancer operates at the Network layer of the OSI model, hence the name.
This load balancer is specially designed for web applications with HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
It also provides advanced routing features such as "host-based and path-based routing" and also works with containers and microservices.

Host-based Routing
Suppose you have two websites medium.com and admin.medium.com. Each website is hosted on two EC2 instances for high availability and you want to distribute the incoming web traffic between them.
If you were using the CLB you would have to create two load balancers, one for each website.
But you can do the same thing using a single ALB!
Hence you will be saving money as you will only be paying for a single ALB instead of two CLBs.

Path-based Routing
Suppose the website of your company is payzello.com and the company’s blog is hosted on payzello.com/blog. The operations team has decided to host the main website and the blog on different instances.
Using ALB you can route traffic based on the path of the requested URL. So again a single ALB is enough to handle this for you.

- ALB designed for microservice based applications.
- In microservices based applications we generally need routing based on port and based on path.
- Maintain one ALB to routes the traffic to the different microservices instead of having one load balancer to each microservices.

There are different components
- ALB
- listeners
- Target groups

Suppose There are 2 microservices 
- orders
- payments

Target Groups :-
Target Groups contains running group of ec2 instances for a specific microservice.
There are n number of target groups for n number of microservices.

listens :-
We have 2 listens which helps making routing decisions.
It helps ALB when to route traffic to the orders and when to the payments.

The Routing can happen based on the path i.e when request comes to the ALB 
and containing '/orders/*' to the path it is routed to the orders microservice and vice versa for '/payments/*'.
The same way routing decision can be made based on the port i.e suppose 80 for orders and 90 for payments.  

3. Network Load Balancer (NLB)
This load balancer operates at the Network layer of the OSI model, hence the name.
Suppose your company’s website is running on four m4-xlarge instances and you are using an ALB to distribute the traffic among them.
Now your company launched a new product today which got viral and your website starts to get millions of requests per second.
In this case, the ALB may not be able to handle the sudden spike in traffic.
This is where the NLB really shines. It has the capability to handle a sudden spike in traffic since it works at the connection level.
It also provides support for static IPs.
