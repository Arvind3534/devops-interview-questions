ELB:-
usecases:
- horizontal scaling by adding more and more ec2 instances.
- highly available, by deploying aur application across diff AZs.
- In case of zone failure our applcation still running and there will not be downtime for that.

Feature:
- Elb is specific to VPC
- It can load balance ec2 instance which are in same VPC
- It can't load balance ec2 instance across multiple VPCs
- It can't load balance ec2 instance across multiple regions (use Route53)
- It is a fully managed service.
- It can be secured by using security groups
- It performs health checks, to make sure it only route to the healthy instances.
- It support SSL termination, When we configure hhtps using ssl certificate.

ALB :
- ALB designed for microservice based applications.
- In microservices based applications we generally need routing based on port and based on path.
- Maintain one ALB to routes the traffic to the different microservices instead of having one load balancer to each microservices.

There are different components
- ALB
- listeners
- Target groups

Suppose There are 2 microservices 
- orders
- payments

Target Groups :-
Target Groups contains running group of ec2 instances for a specific microservice.
There are n number of target groups for n number of microservices.

listens :-
We have 2 listens which helps making routing decisions.
It helps ALB when to route traffic to the orders and when to the payments.

The Routing can happen based on the path i.e when request comes to the ALB 
and containing '/orders/*' to the path it is routed to the orders microservice and vice versa for '/payments/*'.
The same way routing decision can be made based on the port i.e suppose 80 for orders and 90 for payments.
